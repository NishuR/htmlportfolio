<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  The Labrador Retriever or simply Labrador, is a British breed of retriever gun dog. 
  It was developed in the United Kingdom from fishing dogs imported from the colony of Newfoundland (now a province of Canada), 
  and was named after the Labrador region of that colony. 
  It is among the most commonly kept dogs in several countries, particularly in the Western world.

<p>The Labrador is friendly, energetic, and playful. It was bred as a sporting and hunting dog but is widely kept as a companion dog. 
  It may also be trained as a guide or assistance dog, or for rescue or therapy work.
